                <p>
                    After graduating from <span>Elon University</span> with a degree in Biology, I spent six years
                as an educator, both state-side and abroad. Eventually, I decided to take my passions for education,
                travel and wildlife conservation to the <span>Flatiron School</span> where I gained a new passion
                for building web applications.
                <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                It was here that I found the perfect outlet for my <span>creativity</span>.
                I really enjoy learning from team members and collaborating on projects that hold the
                <span> user experience</span> above all else.
                <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                When I'm not behind the keyboard, you can find me behind a drumset or traveling the world in search of
                rare and endangered species.
